# Project: Making a recipe website with HTML
# Showcase what I have learned so far:
# Basic HTML Boilerplate, <head> and <body> elements
# <p> element - used in paragraphs
# <strong>, <em> - elements to change to bold or italics text respectively
# <ol>, <ul> - for ordered and unordered lists
# <a>, <img> - for links and images
# And the various attributes that can be used for the elements above
