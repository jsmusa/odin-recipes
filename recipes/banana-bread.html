        <p>
            A really rich, dessert bread. Great for quick breakfast or warm with butter
            as a dessert. The walnuts may be omitted if desired. The recipe needs 15 minutes
            of preparation time and cooking time of 1 and 1/2 hours. It's good for 20 servings
            and yields two 9x5 inches loaves.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup shortening</li>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
            <li>6 very ripe bananas, mashed</li>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
            <h3>Optional:</h3>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped walnuts</li>

        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease two 9x5 inch loaf pans.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, cream together the shortening and sugar until light and fluffy. Stir in the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition. Stir in the mayonnaise and bananas. Stir together the flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda. Blend the flour mixture into the banana mixture; stir just enough to evenly combine. Fold in the chocolate chips and walnuts.</li>
            <li>Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean, about 50 to 75 minutes. Cool loaf in the pan for 20 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
