            This is a rich and moist one bowl chocolate cake. It only takes a few minutes
            to prepare the batter. Frost with your favorite chocolate frosting. Again, this is a recipe I've
            pilfered from the <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/17981/one-bowl-chocolate-cake-iii/">allrecipes</a> 
            website. Please check it out for more details.

            This recipe takes 20 minutes of prep time and 30 minutes of cooking. An
            additional 10 minutes maybe needed to fully make the chocolate cake. This 
            recipe is good for 24 servings and yields two 9-inch round cake layers.
